Q9. Relation R(ABCDEFGHI) having dependencies as:
AB->C
BD->EF
AD->GH
A->I
Highest normal form? C.K set?

Sol- Since attributes B and D never appear on the RHS of any dependency, they must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (ABD)+ = ABCDEFGHI

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {ABD}
• PA = {A, B, D}
• NPA = {C, E, F, G, H, I}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies AB->C, BD->EF, AD->GH and A->I violate BCNF because their LHS are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, dependencies AB->C and A->I violate 3NF as RHS has non-prime attributes and LHS is not a superkey.
• In 2NF, partial dependency AB->C exists on candidate key ABD, so 2NF is violated.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF as all attributes are atomic.

Q10. Relation R(ABCDE) having dependencies as:
AB->CD
D->A
BC->DE
Highest normal form? C.K set?

Sol- Since attribute B never appears on the RHS of any dependency, it must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (AB)+ = ABCDE
• (BC)+ = BCDEA

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {AB, BC}
• PA = {A, B, C}
• NPA = {D, E}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies D->A violate BCNF because D is not a superkey.
• In 3NF, dependency D->A violates 3NF as A is a prime attribute but D is not a superkey.
• In 2NF, no partial dependency exists, so 2NF is satisfied.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q11. Consider a relation P having fields F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 with the functional dependencies as follows:
F1->F3
F2->F4
(F1,F2)->F5
In terms of normalization, this table is in which normal form. Describe the prime and non-prime attributes.

Sol- Since F1 and F2 together determine all attributes, they form the candidate key.
Closures:
• (F1F2)+ = F1F2F3F4F5

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {F1, F2}
• PA = {F1, F2}
• NPA = {F3, F4, F5}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies F1->F3 and F2->F4 violate BCNF because F1 and F2 are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, dependencies F1->F3 and F2->F4 violate 3NF as RHS has non-prime attributes.
• In 2NF, partial dependencies F1->F3 and F2->F4 exist, so 2NF is violated.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q12. DBA of a university information management system wants to remove redundancy by considering the following dependencies and relation R(R_N, Name, Dob, Age) for the system. Identify relevant candidate keys and normal form.
Dob->Age
Name->Rno
Age->Eligibility
Rno->Name
C_N->Cname
C_N->Instructor
(R_N, C_N)->Grade

Sol- Since R_N and C_N together determine Grade, they form the candidate key.
Closures:
• (R_N, C_N)+ = R_N, C_N, Name, Dob, Age, Eligibility, Cname, Instructor, Grade

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {R_N, C_N}
• PA = {R_N, C_N}
• NPA = {Name, Dob, Age, Eligibility, Cname, Instructor, Grade}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies Dob->Age and Age->Eligibility violate BCNF because Dob and Age are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, Age->Eligibility violates 3NF as Eligibility is non-prime.
• In 2NF, no partial dependency exists, so 2NF is satisfied.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.
