Q1. Consider a relation R having attributes as R(ABCD), functional dependencies are given below:
AB->C, C->D, D->A
Identify the set of candidate keys possible in relation R. List all the set of prime and non-prime attributes.

Sol- Since attribute B never appears on the RHS of any dependency, it must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (AB)+ = ABCD
• (CB)+ = CBDA
• (DB)+ = DBAC

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {AB, CB, DB}
• PA = {A, B, C}
• NPA = {D}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, the dependencies C->D and D->A violate BCNF because C and D are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, all attributes are prime, so it is satisfied.
• In 2NF, there are no partial dependencies, so it is satisfied.
• In 1NF, the relation is already in 1NF as all attributes are atomic.

Q2. Relation R(ABCDE) having functional dependencies as:
A->D, B->A, BC->D, AC->BE
Identify the set of candidate keys possible in relation R. List all the set of prime and non-prime attributes.

Sol- Since attribute C never appears on the RHS of any dependency, it must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (AC)+ = ACBED
• (BC)+ = ACDBE

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {AC, BC}
• PA = {A, B, C}
• NPA = {D, E}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies A->D and B->A violate BCNF because A and B are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, dependency B->A violates 3NF.
• In 2NF, A->D is a partial dependency, so 2NF is violated.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q3. Consider a relation R having attributes as R(ABCDE), functional dependencies are given below:
B->A, A->C, BC->D, AC->BE
Identify the set of candidate keys possible in relation R. List all the set of prime and non-prime attributes.

Sol- All attributes appear on the RHS, so candidate keys are found using closure.
Closures:
• (A)+ = ACBED
• (B)+ = BACDE

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {A, B}
• PA = {A, B}
• NPA = {C, D, E}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, all dependencies have superkeys on LHS, so BCNF is satisfied.
• In 3NF, BCNF implies 3NF is satisfied.
• In 2NF, no partial dependency exists, so 2NF is satisfied.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q4. Consider a relation R having attributes as R(ABCDEF), functional dependencies are given below:
A->BCD, BC->DE, B->D, D->A
Identify the set of candidate keys possible in relation R. List all the set of prime and non-prime attributes.

Sol- Since attribute F never appears on the RHS of any dependency, it must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (AF)+ = ABCDEF
• (BF)+ = BFEDAC
• (DF)+ = DFABCE

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {AF, BF, DF}
• PA = {A, B, D, F}
• NPA = {C, E}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies A->BCD, B->D and D->A violate BCNF.
• In 3NF, A->BCD violates 3NF because RHS has non-prime attributes.
• In 2NF, no partial dependency exists, so 2NF is satisfied.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q7. Relation R(ABCDE) having dependencies as:
CE->D, D->B, C->A
Highest normal form? C.K set?

Sol- Since attributes C and E never appear on the RHS of any dependency, they must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (CE)+ = CEDBA

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {CE}
• PA = {C, E}
• NPA = {A, B, D}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies D->B and C->A violate BCNF because D and C are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, dependencies D->B and C->A violate 3NF.
• In 2NF, partial dependency C->A exists, so 2NF is violated.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF.

Q8. Relation R(ABCDEF) having dependencies as:
AB->C, DC->AE, E->F
Highest normal form? C.K set?

Sol- Since attribute B and D never appear on the RHS of any dependency, they must be part of every candidate key.
Closures:
• (ABD)+ = ABCDEF

Keys:
• Candidate Keys = {ABD}
• PA = {A, B, D}
• NPA = {C, E, F}

Normalization check:
• In BCNF, dependencies AB->C and E->F violate BCNF because AB and E are not superkeys.
• In 3NF, dependency E->F violates 3NF because E is not a superkey and F is a non-prime attribute.
• In 2NF, partial dependency AB->C exists since AB is a proper subset of candidate key ABD, so 2NF is violated.
• In 1NF, the relation satisfies 1NF as all attributes are atomic.
